# What's Figgy?

Figgy is a _free_ and _opensource_ application config framework designed to bring simplicity, security, and resilience to 
application config management. Never roll another application to production having forgotten to set that last pesky
config in production. 

Figgy makes it possible to bind your code directly to config versions, thereby enabling you to break builds if configs 
are missing and application deployments are destined to fail.

Figgy makes it easy to set up and control access to across all of your AWS environments and configuration namespaces.

Hey there :wave:. I'm Jordan, a full-stack developer in the reasonably-acceptable state of South Carolina. In my free time I love
playing hoops with long-time friends and watching NBA games. Both of which corona has ruined -- along side everything else. 
Oh, yeah and my wife is really great too since she hasn't murdered me for spending all my nights and weekends working on 
Figgy and trying to bring this dream to life :)

I also host the [Charleston AWS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/CHS-Amazon-Web-Services/) group and would love to meet 
you at our next remote or in-person session!


## My tech background

I started out as a full-stack dev that spent his weekends managing a server-room and trying to keep Hadoop happy on the
weekends. The misery of managing my own mini-datacenter prepared me to fully embrace the wonders of 
cloud computing and resulted in me being knee-deep in AWS for the better part of the last 9 years. 

My favorite types of applications to build are highly-distributed serverless applications that wire together many disparate 
parts into a beautiful and cohesive platform. Like Figgy :wink:!

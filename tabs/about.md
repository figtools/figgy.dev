Hey there! :wave:

I'm [Jordan](https://github.com/mancej), a full-stack developer from the moderately-acceptable state of South Carolina. 
Since "the corona" ruined everything and it's not safe to go out, I've decided to spend every hour of my free-time building 
this platform. 

I also host the [Charleston AWS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/CHS-Amazon-Web-Services/) group and would love to meet 
you at our next remote or in-person session!


## My tech background
<br/>
I distinctly remember the pre cloud-computing days and the hell of trying to maintain an in-house data center.
This perspective has driven my deep appreciation for AWS and other cloud platforms. I've been poking AWS day-to-day for about 
8 or 9 years now and have never looked back. Most recently, I've enjoyed building high volume streaming architectures 
leveraging Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, and WebSockets, but I'm always looking to learn something new 
and never know what might spark my interest next. 

P.S. 

I'm not too good on the front-end so if one of these websites looks off please _feel free_ to send me some hints on the 
[Figgy Slack](https://slack.figgy.dev) or even [Submit a PR](https://github.com/mancej/figgy.dev) :wink:.

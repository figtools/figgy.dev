Hey there! :wave:

I'm [Jordan](https://github.com/mancej), a full-stack developer from the moderately-acceptable state of South Carolina. 
Since "the corona" ruined everything and it's not safe to go out, I've decided to spend every hour of my free-time building 
this platform. 

I also host the [Charleston AWS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/CHS-Amazon-Web-Services/) group and would love to meet 
you at our next remote or in-person session!


## My tech background
<br/>
Over the my career my interest has gravitated towards cloud computing, serverless, DevSecOps, big data, and solving the unique 
problems that emerge at scale. Most recently, I've enjoyed building high volume streaming architectures 
leveraging Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, and WebSockets, but I'm always looking to learn something new 
and never know what might spark my interest next. 

P.S. 

I'm not too good on the front-end so if one of these websites looks off please _feel free_ to send me some hints on the 
[Figgy Slack](https://slack.figgy.dev) or even [Submit a PR](https://github.com/mancej/figgy.dev) :wink:.
